# This playbook, requires a host called coordinator and a host or group called peers
# purpose:
# The playbook synchronizes all on-demand managed devices a coordinator to a peer
# This can be used to create a HA setup, where one Nodegrid can go offline,
# and users can maintain full control through a redundant system
