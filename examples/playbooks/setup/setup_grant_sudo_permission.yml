# Requirements: None
# purpose:
# This playbook can be used to grant the ansible user sudoers permissions
# The module uses it's own ssh connection which is not dependent on a current ansible connection.
# The use case is to easly configure a default Nodegrid appliance, so that it can be used with ansible
