# Requirements: None
# purpose:
# This playbook can be used to change the password for a user including default password for the admin user,
# install a ssh key for a defined user and grant the ansible user sudoers permissions
# The module uses it's own ssh connection which is not dependent on a current ansible connection.
# The use case is to easly configure a default Nodegrid appliance, so that it can be used with ansible
