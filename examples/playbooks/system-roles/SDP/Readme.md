# ZPE Service Delivery Platform (SDP) Solution


## Executive Summary
ZPE Systems provides an Out-of-Band (OOB) **Service Delivery Platform (SDP)** which is a novel solution that enables the management and deployment of Virtualized services in the form of Virtual Machines or Containers. The SDP solution provides an isolated framework that allows the configuration and instantiation of specialized services to further enhance the management and operations of your infrastructure. 

# Introduction
ZPE Systems focuses on Out-of-Band Network and Infrastructure Management solutions. It provides a variety of solutions that enables the management of your distributed infrastructure in a unified platform. Depending on your specific requirements, multiple hardware boxes have being designed in order to manage your infrastructure and network devices via, for example, serial console ports. All the boxes run the ZPE Nodegrid Operating System.

ZPE solutions have evolved from initially being focused on providing remote management access to Data Center infrastructure devices (e.g., servers and network devices' serial ports) to become a hybrid distributed solution that enables a platform for deploying services that can be specific and specialized for infrastructure management and operations. These services can be deployed in a virtualized environment via both virtual machines or containers.



# ZPE Service Delivery Platform SDP
The ZPE SDP solution focuses on providing DevOps teams an OOB platform to deploy specialized services for managing their infrastructure. This solution extends the remote management access capabilities to enhanced management operations by user defined services that are deployed close to the managed devices. These services can be deployed on different ZPE devices either as a virtual machine or a container.

This document considers the case of deploying a service on a Nodegrid Device in the form of a virtual machine. The following requirements are taken into consideration:

- Configure a brand new Nodegrid device, it includes its network connections, firewall, and hypervisor.
- Deploy a list of Virtual Machines
- All configurations are automated using Ansible

## SDP Example Use Case

This section provides an overview of how a Virtualized Service can be deployed using ZPE Systems' Nodegrid solution. It utilizes the ZPE Systems Ansible Library to automate the setup and configuration process.

The example considers the following scenario for the *Acme* company:

- A ZPE GateSR device is used for OOB management, and it is required to deploy an specialized service on it.
- The specialized service can be packaged and executed in a virtualized environment. For this example, a virtual machine is used.
- The virtual machine requires specific network layout and configuration.

The GateSR network interfaces and layout are as follows:
- Two SFP interfaces
- 1 ETH0 interface
- 1 Switch
  - 8 Ethernet ports (i.e., netS1, netS2, ..., netS8)
  - 2 Backplane ports (i.e., backplane0, and backplane1)

The following diagram shows the network layout:

![](figs/gatesr_switch.png)

Based on the GateSR capabilities, the following picture depicts the desired virtualized service configuration. It considers the deployment of a **SilverPeak virtual machine** with an specific network layout:
- Three WAN interfaces, which must be attached to the VM and provide IP-Passthrough (ADD REFERENCE).
- A VM management VLAN
- A Nodegrid management VLAN (vlan_id 254). It interconnects the following interfaces: bacplane1.254 (VLAN interface), and netS8 (untagged). 
- WAN VLAN (vlan_id 250). It interconnects the following interfaces: bacplane1.200 (VLAN interface), and netS7 (untagged). 
- A local VLAN (vlan_id 1). This is the default VLAN. It interconnects the netS6 interface (untagged)
- A local VLAN (vlan_id 2). It interconnects the following interfaces: bacplane0.2 (VLAN interface), and netS1, netS2, netS3, netS4, netS5 (all untagged). 

The following network bridges are considered:

| Bridge Connection | Attached Interfaces |
|:---|:---|
| MGMT0 (br0) | VM |
| WAN0 (br1) | VM, ETH0 |
| WAN1 (br2) | VM, backplane1.200 |
| WAN2 (br3) | VM, wlan0 |
| LAN0 (br4) | VM, backplane0.2 |
| MGMT1 (br0) | backplane1.254 |


![](figs/diagram.png)


This guide assumes that the GateSR device is used as an Ansible host that will provision itself. The Guide assumes that only a minimal configuration was performed on the appliance and that the devices is provisioned with multiple WAN connections. Furthermore, as an example, the device's switch is configured in an specific scenario considering LAN segmentation by using VLANs.

```
- The Ansible Nodegrid Library has been successfully installed. The next step is to define the `inventory.yaml` file, which is a **strict requirement for the SDP use case**.

## Step 3: Build the Ansible Inventory
### Overview
This step is critical, as these settings will be used as a source of truth for all appliances and will determine which settings get applied to each system. The Inventory should match the designed layout. The following section outlines a few basic concepts. For more information about the Ansible Inventory option, see [How to Build Your Inventory](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html)

Inventory Overview
1. The inventory is organized hierarchically and utilizes groups that can be nested.
2. Infrastructure devices like Nodegrid appliances are represented as `hosts` which can be part of one or multiple groups
3. Each group and host can have multiple variables assigned to it. These Variables are typically `key-value` pairs but can be in the form of `lists` and `dictionaries`
4. The Ansible inventory files utilize standard `YAML` or `JSON` notation. Both are valid, but ideally should not be mixed to avoid confusion. This document will only use `YAML` notation.
5. The default location for the Ansible inventory on a Nodegrid appliance is `/etc/ansible/inventories/`
6. The Inventory is stored in `YAML` files. The main file is the `hosts.yml` file, which must contain the inventory structure. 


> [!Note]
> 
> ZPE Systems Dynamic Inventory Plugins
> 
> ZPE Systems currently supports three dynamic inventory plugins:
> 1. **Cluster plugin**: This exposes all cluster hosts to a local installation of Ansible on a Nodegrid appliance. This is installed and active by default and only requires a working Cluster configuration
> 2. **Device plugin**: This Exposes all locally configured managed devices on Nodegrid appliance. This plugin is automatically installed with the Nodegrid Ansible library.
> 3. **ZPE Cloud plugin**: This plugin enables the execution of Ansible playbooks via ZPE Cloud as the connector, and the use of the ZPE Cloud inventory and custom fields as inventory on a local Ansible host. [Ansible ZPE Cloud](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/zpe/zpecloud/) describes in detail this plugin.

### Inventory Structure
Configure the Inventory

1. Navigate to the Inventory folder
```bash
cd /etc/ansible/inventories/
```
2. Edit the `hosts.yaml` file and create the inventory
```bash
vim hosts.yaml
```
3.  Example `hosts.yaml` file without variables, based on the provided Example
```hosts.yaml
all:
  children:
    company:
      children:
        USA:
          children:
            CA:
              hosts:
               ng-gatesr1:
```

> [!Tip]
> 
> It is recommended to utilize a group that identifies the organization/company. This serves to clearly differentiate manually configured hosts from hosts provided through an automated inventory plugin, like the Nodegrid Cluster inventory plugin, which exposes all Nodegrid Cluster nodes.


4. To test the current inventory changes, run the command the following command which will show and validate the inventory structure:
```bash
ansible-inventory --graph
```
Example Output:
```bash
``ansible@ng-gatesr1:/etc/ansible/inventories$ ansible-inventory --graph
@all:
  |--@cluster:
  |  |--@local:
  |  |  |--localhost
  |  |--@peers:
  |--@company:
  |  |--@USA:
  |  |  |--@CA:
  |  |  |  |--ng-gatesr1
  |--@managed_devices:
  |  |--@device_disabled:
  |  |  |--HumiditySensor
  |  |  |--ttyS2-switch1
  |  |  |--ttyS3
  |  |  |--ttyS4
  |  |  |--ttyS5
  |  |  |--ttyS6
  |  |  |--ttyS7
  |  |  |--ttyS8
  |  |  |--usbS0-3
  |  |  |--usbS0-4
  |  |--@device_enabled:
  |  |  |--NSC
  |  |  |--TemperatureSensor
  |  |  |--ttyS1-router1
  |  |--@device_ondemand:
  |  |--@ilo:
  |  |  |--NSC
  |  |--@local_serial:
  |  |  |--ttyS1-router1
  |  |  |--ttyS2-switch1
  |  |  |--ttyS3
  |  |  |--ttyS4
  |  |  |--ttyS5
  |  |  |--ttyS6
  |  |  |--ttyS7
  |  |  |--ttyS8
  |  |--@usb_serialB:
  |  |  |--HumiditySensor
  |  |  |--TemperatureSensor
  |  |  |--usbS0-3
  |  |  |--usbS0-4
  |  |--HumiditySensor
  |  |--NSC
  |  |--TemperatureSensor
  |  |--ttyS1-router1
  |  |--ttyS2-switch1
  |  |--ttyS3
  |  |--ttyS4
  |  |--ttyS5
  |  |--ttyS6
  |  |--ttyS7
  |  |--ttyS8
  |  |--usbS0-3
  |  |--usbS0-4
  |--@ungrouped:
```
To display host-specific settings use the following command
```bash
ansible-inventory --host ng-gatesr1
```

Example Output:
```bash
ansible@ng-gatesr1:/etc/ansible/inventories$ ansible-inventory --host ng-gatesr1
{}
```

> [!Warning]
> 
>  The inventory output for the specific host is currently still empty as no variables have been defined. This will be done during the following steps.

### Group Variables
- Variables can be stored in the `hosts.yaml` file or in dedicated variable files, which are stored in the `group_vars` sub-folders. 

> [!Tip]
> 
> It is recommended to store group variables in dedicated files, for example, variables which apply to all hosts can be stored in the file `group_vars/company.yaml` 
-  Navigate to the Inventory folder  
```bash
cd /etc/ansible/inventories/group_vars  
```

- Create the file `company.yaml`, which will contain variables which apply to all hosts
```bash
vim company.yaml 
```

> [!Warning]
> 
> The file name must match the group name used in the inventory in this case 'company.yaml'

- Add the following content. This includes the minimum requirements for the intended example.

### Host Specific Variables (`ng-gatesr1`)
- Host-specific variables can be stored either in the `hosts.yaml` file, or similar to group variables in individual files. 
  
> [!Tip]
> 
> It is recommended to store host-specific variables in host-specific files. These files are located in the folder `host_vars` and would typically have the name of the host, for example, `ng-gatesr1.yaml`

> [!Warning]
> 
> **OVERWRITING OF VARIABLES**
> 
>  Variables with the same name, that are defined on a host level will overwrite group-level variables; this allows us to have generic defaults defined on group levels, which then get overwritten with specific values on a lower level.

- For this example, we will store the variable inside the `host_vars` directory
- Edit the `ng-gatesr1.yaml` file
```
vim /etc/ansible/inventories/host_vars/ng-gatesr1.yaml
```
- Add the following content.

> [!Tip]
>
> It is recommended to configure some base settings. Other settings can be added later. The below example defines the required variables for the SDP example. Adjust the values are required.

```
- Now that all required variables for the GateSR are defined, we can validate that the inventory is working before continuing:
```bash
ansible-inventory --host ng-gatesr1
```
- The output will now contain the host-specific variables
- To test the Ansible connection with the host use the following command
```shell
ansible -m ping ng-gatesr1
```

> [!Warning]
> 
>  This command will only be successful if the target host is the local system. 
>  In the case of a remote target, the user `ssh_keys` must be installed first on the remote system. This is covered in the section [[#Configure a new host]]

Example Output:
```shell
ansible@ng-gatesr1:/etc/ansible/inventories/host_vars$ ansible -m ping ng-gatesr1
ng-gatesr1 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```

## Step 4: Configure Nodegrid on Local System
At this point, everything is ready to configure the GateSR SDP use case. If we want to change any configurations in future, we only have to adjust the inventory variables, and the changes will be on the next run applied to all of the specific systems.

To push the configuration, use the following commands.

### Setup the Network
- Navigate to the playbooks folder.
```shell
cd /etc/ansible/playbooks/
```
- Execute the playbook `100_configure_network.yaml`. In this example, we limit the target node execution to the currently configured system `ng-gatesr1`
```
ansible-playbook 100_configure_network.yaml --limit ng-gatesr1
```

Example Output:
```
ansible@ng-gatesr1:/etc/ansible/playbooks$ ansible-playbook 100_configure_network.yaml --limit ng-gatesr1

PLAY [all] *********************************************************************

TASK [Setup Audit Settings] ****************************************************

TASK [zpe.nodegrid.auditing : Apply Auditing Settings] *************************

...

PLAY RECAP *******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
ng-gatesr1                     : ok=26   changed=18   unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=4    rescued=0    ignored=0
```

- The network configuration is not in place.

### Setup the VM
- Install Ansible community libvirt

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.libvirt
```

- Navigate to the playbooks folder.
```shell
cd /etc/ansible/playbooks/
```
- Execute the playbook `200_create_virtual_machines.yaml`. In this example, we limit the target node execution to the currently configured system `ng-gatesr1`
```
ansible-playbook 200_create_virtual_machines.yaml --limit ng-gatesr1
```

- The VM is now deployed and running on the GateSR.

# Final Result

The following pictures show the VM instantiated on the GateSR:
