# Requirements: existing ansible connection, with shell access
# purpose:
# This playbook can be used to perform a firmware upgrade on a Nodegrid device.
# The playbook, will validated at the end that ansible can still communicate with the device and
# that the firmware update was successfull.
# The playbook, implements validation checks, when any of teh checks fails it is not recommended to
# upgrade the units until the issues are addressed
